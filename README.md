# Censorship-Shader  
A project about creating distortion effects that influence the way images and textures are displayed. We worked solely in Unity, creating shader scripts for four different effects as well as C# scripts for swapping between those shaders. In addition, we also created realtime shader manipulation by implementing a UI with sliders to change the respective settings.
